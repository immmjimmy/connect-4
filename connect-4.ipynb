    "- GUI was built using Tkinter\n",
    "- Bot was built using Python3 and uses the [alpha-beta pruning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)\n",
    "    - Comes with two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard\n",
    "        - Easy looks 3 turns ahead.\n",
    "        - Hard looks 4 turns ahead.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Uses a heuristic that determines the state of the board by the number of 4-in-a-rows a player could make\n",
    "- Allows user to play against another human through a selection menu\n",
    "- Comes with a back button to undo the previous turn (and the turns before that)"
